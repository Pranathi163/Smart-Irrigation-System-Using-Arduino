# Smart-Irrigation-System-Using-Arduino
This project is a simple yet effective automatic irrigation system using an Arduino Uno, a soil moisture sensor, and a relay-controlled water pump. The system turns the water pump ON when the soil is dry and OFF when the soil is adequately moist, helping conserve water and keep plants healthy.
